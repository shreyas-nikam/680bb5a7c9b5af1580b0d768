This application simulates a memory poisoning attack on an agentic AI system. It allows users to inject a 'poisoned' memory string and observe how the agent's behavior changes in response to subsequent inputs. It simulates the "Case study: Memory poisoning attack on an agentic AI email assistant" section, particularly the memory manipulation. The goal is to provide an interactive way to understand how such attacks work and how system prompts can be designed to mitigate them.
