# Streamlit Application Codelab: Understanding and Utilizing a Simple Data Display

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing a basic Streamlit application. While a full `app.py` is unavailable due to restrictions, we will focus on the key concepts and functionalities typically found in such an application. Streamlit is a powerful Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications for data science and machine learning with minimal effort. This codelab will equip you with the knowledge to build upon a simple Streamlit app and create more complex and useful applications. We will be going over creating the basic layout, input widgets, data display elements and basic interactivity.

## Setting Up Your Environment
Duration: 00:05

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the necessary tools installed.

1.  **Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

2.  **Streamlit:** Install Streamlit using pip:
    ```console
    pip install streamlit
    ```

3.  **Other Libraries (if needed):** If your application requires other libraries such as Pandas or NumPy, install them as well:
    ```console
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```

It's a best practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies for your Python projects. This helps avoid conflicts between different projects. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.

## Understanding the Basic Structure of a Streamlit App
Duration: 00:10

A Streamlit app is essentially a Python script. When you run the script using `streamlit run your_app.py`, Streamlit executes the script and renders the output in a web browser. The core elements of a Streamlit app include:

*   **Importing Streamlit:**  You start by importing the Streamlit library: `import streamlit as st`
*   **Adding Text and Titles:** You can add text, titles, and headings using functions like `st.title()`, `st.header()`, `st.subheader()`, and `st.write()`.
*   **Input Widgets:** Streamlit provides a variety of input widgets, such as `st.slider()`, `st.selectbox()`, `st.text_input()`, and `st.button()`, to allow users to interact with the app.
*   **Data Display:** You can display data using functions like `st.dataframe()`, `st.table()`, `st.line_chart()`, `st.bar_chart()`, and `st.map()`.

## Building a Simple Data Display App (Conceptual)
Duration: 00:15

Let's imagine how a simple Streamlit app to display data might look. Since we don't have a functional `app.py` available, we'll walk through the conceptual steps.

1.  **Import Libraries:**
    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    ```

2.  **Create Sample Data:** (This would ideally come from a file or database)
    ```python
    data = {'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            'col2': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

3.  **Add Title and Description:**
    ```python
    st.title('Simple Data Display')
    st.write('This is a simple Streamlit app to display data.')
    ```

4.  **Display Dataframe:**
    ```python
    st.dataframe(df) # or st.table(df) for a static table
    ```

5.  **Add a Chart (Optional):**
    ```python
    st.line_chart(df)
    ```
## Adding Interactivity with Widgets
Duration: 00:20

Now, let's enhance the app by adding some interactive widgets. Suppose we want to filter the data based on a user-selected value.

1.  **Add a Selectbox:**
    ```python
    selected_col = st.selectbox('Select a column to display:', ['col1', 'col2'])
    ```

2.  **Filter and Display Data:**
    ```python
    st.write(f'You selected: {selected_col}')
    st.write(df[selected_col]) #Display the selected Column
    ```

3.  **Add a Slider (Optional):** To filter data based on a range:
    ```python
    value = st.slider(
         "Select a range of values",
         0.0, 100.0, (25.0, 75.0)
    )
    st.write("You selected:", value)
    ```

<aside class="positive">
Streamlit automatically reruns the script whenever a widget value changes, updating the output in the browser. This makes it easy to create interactive applications.
</aside>

## Understanding Streamlit's Execution Model
Duration: 00:10

Streamlit apps are executed from top to bottom each time a user interacts with a widget. This means that when you change the value of a slider or click a button, the entire script is rerun. Streamlit efficiently caches the results of expensive computations to avoid recomputing them unnecessarily.

## Deploying Your Streamlit App
Duration: 00:10

Once you're happy with your Streamlit app, you can deploy it to share it with others. Several options are available:

*   **Streamlit Cloud:** Streamlit Cloud is the easiest way to deploy Streamlit apps. It's a free platform that automatically builds, deploys, and hosts your apps.
*   **Heroku:** Heroku is a popular cloud platform that you can use to deploy Streamlit apps.
*   **AWS, Google Cloud, Azure:** You can also deploy Streamlit apps to other cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

<aside class="negative">
Make sure to include a `requirements.txt` file in your project to specify the dependencies required by your app. This file is used by deployment platforms to install the necessary packages. You can generate a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
</aside>

## Advanced Features (Brief Overview)
Duration: 00:10

Streamlit offers a wide range of advanced features, including:

*   **Caching:** Use `@st.cache_data` and `@st.cache_resource` to cache expensive computations and improve performance.
*   **Sessions:** Use `st.session_state` to store variables across reruns of the script.
*   **Layouts:** Use `st.columns()` and `st.expander()` to create more complex layouts.
*   **Theming:** Customize the appearance of your app using themes.
*   **Components:** Create reusable components to extend Streamlit's functionality.

## Conclusion

This codelab has provided a basic understanding of Streamlit and how to build a simple data display application. By leveraging Streamlit's intuitive API and powerful features, you can create interactive web applications for data exploration, visualization, and sharing your insights with others. Remember to consult the Streamlit documentation for more detailed information and examples. Experiment with different widgets, data display options, and advanced features to create even more compelling and useful applications.
