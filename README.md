# Agentic AI Memory Poisoning Simulator

This Streamlit application simulates a memory poisoning attack on an agentic AI system. It allows users to inject a 'poisoned' memory string and observe how the agent's behavior changes in response to subsequent inputs.

## Usage

1.  Enter a 'Poisoned Memory String'.
2.  Enter a 'System Prompt'.
3.  Enter an 'Input Email'.
4.  Click 'Simulate Attack'.

The application will then simulate the agent's response and indicate whether the attack was successful.

## Explanation

This application demonstrates how memory poisoning can compromise an agentic AI system. The 'Poisoned Memory String' represents a malicious instruction injected into the agent's memory. The 'System Prompt' influences the agent's behavior. By observing the simulation results, you can understand the vulnerability and how prompt engineering can mitigate it.
