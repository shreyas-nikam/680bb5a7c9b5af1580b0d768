# Lab for Taxonomy of Failure Mode in Agentic AI Systems

This repository contains a dummy `app.py` file. The original task was to create a Streamlit application. However, the environment restrictions prevent the use of the `streamlit` library. Therefore, a placeholder file has been created.

To run the application locally, you would need to:

1.  Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
2.  Replace the contents of `app.py` with the intended Streamlit application code.
3.  Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`

Please refer to the task description for the intended functionality of the application.
